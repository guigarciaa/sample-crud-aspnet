# Sample CRUD Backend in ASP.NET Core

This code represents a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) backend implementation in ASP.NET Core.

It allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data from a database using HTTP requests.

The code is organized into separate controllers for each entity, with corresponding methods for each CRUD operation.

The controllers use Entity Framework Core to interact with the database, and the code is designed to be easily extendable
to support additional entities and operations as needed.
